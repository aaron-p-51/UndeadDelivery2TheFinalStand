## Game Details
After the town of Pleasant View suffers a zombie outbreak, there is only one survivor â€” Dan the Delivery Man.

Realizing this crisis offers him a unique business opportunity, Dan heads to the local morgue. He fills his delivery van full of brains.

He arranges a meeting with the zombie mayor and they reach an agreement where Dan won't get eaten as long as he keeps delivering fresh brains to the residents.

After guiding Dan down the roads of Pleasant View and delivering the brains to the resident's doorsteps he eventually crashes his van.

No problem because Dan has a converted t-shirt cannon he can use to launch brains to the resident zombies! Just make sure to match the same color brain to the same color zombie.
